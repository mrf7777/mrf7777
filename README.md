- Hello, Iâ€™m @mrf7777
- Iâ€™m interested in anything software related.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development.

I enjoy making projects that bring interesting technologies together or are useful to anyone who wants them.
For example, in my repository [Modular-OS-Toolchain](https://github.com/mrf7777/Modular-OS-Toolchain), I bring together a development platform in a [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/561915473/) project together with standard software tools.
